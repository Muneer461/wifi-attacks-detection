<h1>WiFi Deauthentication Detection using ESP8266</h1>
<p>This project shows how to detect WiFi deauthentication attacks using an ESP8266 board. A WiFi deauthentication attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that can disconnect any device from a WiFi network by sending fake deauthentication frames. This can be used for testing and educational purposes, but also for malicious attacks.</p>
<p>This project uses an ESP8266 board with NodeMCU firmware, which can be programmed using Arduino IDE. The board has a LED that will light up in different colors depending on the type of deauthentication frame detected. The board can also send the information to a serial monitor or a web server.</p>
