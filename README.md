<h1>WiFi Deauthentication Detection using ESP8266</h1>
<p>This project shows how to detect WiFi deauthentication attacks using an ESP8266 board. A WiFi deauthentication attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that can disconnect any device from a WiFi network by sending fake deauthentication frames. This can be used for testing and educational purposes, but also for malicious attacks.</p>
<p>This project uses an ESP8266 board with NodeMCU firmware, which can be programmed using Arduino IDE. The board has a LED that will light up in different colors depending on the type of deauthentication frame detected. The board can also send the information to a serial monitor or a web server.</p>

<h3>Here sample video</h3>
<p>make same As it is in the video but change the code as I given and a change just wifi username and password and compile the code in Ardino and inject to ESP8266 module </p>
